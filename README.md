## Description
One of the most common and cost effective secondary recovery techniques used in the industry is Electrical Submersible Pump (ESP). With dynamic and changing operating environments, it is essential to continuously monitor and diagnose ESP operating conditions, leveraging real time information received from the pump, to optimize its run life and avoid premature failures.

## Objective
This protoype was set up to test an alternative view in data visualization to oil and water flow from an electrical submersible pump during asset optimization. ESP pumps have the ability to pump very large volumes of fluid, by decreasing the bottom hole pressure allowing oil to flow from the reservoir and adding energy from the pump and electric motor to produce the fluid to surface.

## Requirements
• Visually show the flow of oil and water particles as the values in surface flow rate change.</br>
• Vary the particle sizes to potentialy convey viscocity.</br>
• Vary speed among particles to convey flow rate and speed.</br>
• Bottomhole pressure, frequency, temperature, WHP and pressure must display increase and decreases as the flowrate changes.
